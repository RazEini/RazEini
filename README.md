## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 [Smart Task Flow](https://github.com/RazEini/Smart_Task_Flow)
**Motivation:** Most task managers are just "to-do lists" that eventually become cluttered. I wanted to build a tool that actively helps with decision-making—telling me *what* to do next based on priority and urgency.
* **The Challenge:** Designing an automated prioritization logic that feels intuitive and doesn't overwhelm the user.
* **Key Learning:** This was my deep dive into **Jetpack Compose** and **MVVM** architecture. I learned how to manage complex UI states while keeping the business logic clean and decoupled.
* **Tech Stack:** Kotlin, Firebase.

### 🛒 [E-Commerce Shop](https://github.com/RazEini/e_commerce_shop)
**Motivation:** I wanted to understand how large-scale consumer apps maintain data consistency between thousands of users and an admin dashboard.
* **The Challenge:** Implementing a real-time shopping cart that syncs across multiple devices and handles instant inventory updates during checkout.
* **Key Learning:** Mastered **Firebase Realtime Database** and user authentication. This project taught me the importance of UX—designing an Admin Panel that makes complex management tasks feel simple.
* **Tech Stack:** Android (Java), Firebase.

### 💬 [SmartChat – Hebrew Chatbot](https://github.com/RazEini/smart_chat_bot)
**Motivation:** Many AI tools struggle with Hebrew out-of-the-box or lack a lightweight interface for custom integration. I aimed to create a solution that combines AI power with a clean, responsive web interface.
* **The Challenge:** Bridging the gap between a **Python/Flask** backend and a responsive frontend while managing session history without bloating the database.
* **Key Learning:** This project sharpened my **Full-stack** development skills. I learned how to handle API security and how to structure a Flask app to be modular and scalable.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, HTML/CSS/JS.

### 🔐 [Password Manager](https://github.com/RazEini/Password_Manager)
**Motivation:** As a software engineer, I wanted to move away from third-party managers and build my own "vault" to fully understand how encryption works under the hood.
* **The Challenge:** Correctly implementing the **AES-128-GCM** encryption protocol. In security, there is no "almost"—it's either secure or it's not.
* **Key Learning:** This was a masterclass in **Cybersecurity fundamentals**. I learned about Salting, Hashing, and secure local storage, making me a more security-conscious developer in every project I write.
* **Tech Stack:** Python.
