* **The Challenge:** Designing an automated prioritization logic that feels intuitive and doesn't overwhelm the user.
* **Key Learning:** Deep dive into **Jetpack Compose** and **MVVM** architecture. Managed complex UI states while keeping business logic clean and decoupled.
* **Tech Stack:** Kotlin, Firebase.

### 🔐 [Password Manager](https://github.com/RazEini/Password_Manager) 🔗
> **Secure vault implementation using industry-standard encryption protocols**

* **Motivation:** Moving away from third-party managers to build a personal "vault" and fully understand encryption "under the hood."
* **The Challenge:** Correctly implementing the **AES-128-GCM** encryption protocol—ensuring there are no "almosts" in security.
* **Key Learning:** Masterclass in **Cybersecurity fundamentals**: Salting, Hashing, and secure local storage. Developed a "security-first" mindset for development.
* **Tech Stack:** Python.
